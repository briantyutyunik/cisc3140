#1)
 I was successful in recreating the main functionality of the same 
program features as before as bash has nice functionality when it 
comes to dealing with dates as you can specify the format and such. 
Showing the dates was tough and selecting them as well. 

#2)
 Formatting was similar between languages, not syntactically, but 
specification wise. Most of the code was different, however, such as 
syntax, logic, and processing user input. 

#3)
 For java accepting user input is one line but going through the 
data is definitely a lot more work than in bash. Bash just allows 
you to initialize the input as a variable. Displaying is similar 
however with bash it takes only 1 word. Bash also requires less 
imports than java. I definitely still prefer java even though it may 
seem more tedious. It is much easier to read/write as well as 
produces much more functionalities.

#4) 
I used Scanner, FileInputStream, and in bash I just imported the 
bash location. I would not have been able to complete either program 
without importing as the compiler would automatically make this an 
issue to proceeed.

Make File target vs Shell scripts

I think it is fairly similar to write make files in comparison to shell 
scripts. However, the syntax is much simpler for make files and it is 
easier.
